# vi inventory
[dev]
node01

[test]
node02

[prod]
node[03:04]

[balancers]
node05

[webservers:children]
prod

To validate the inventory file
# ansible all -i inventory --list-hosts

# vi ansible.cfg

inventory -- shold be line approx 137 
hostkey_checking -- line approx 319 
become_user= jack
collection -- line approx  57
